                 Class -01


Compiler-- Converts the high level code (Source code) into machine code.

Program-- Set of instructions to perform an operation.

Programming- The process of wriing program.

Programer- One who writes the program.

Algortihm- Step  by step planning to solve a problem is called algorithm.


Javascript History-- Originally it named was mocha and launched on 4 december 1995 ,later changed to live script and finally javascript.


Node JS- It is a run time environment and  help to run the js code.


Alert, Propmt ,confirm -- kuch aise terms hote hai  jo vs code me directly run nhi hota hai ,mtlb error aata hai ,
Ye sare BOM hote hai .

Statemnets in J.S -- It is nothing but a synatx and statement is always seprated by semicolon





 #          Class No - 02


 Comments in Code -- Part of code which does not execaute in code and it helps to enhance the code readbility.

 Multiline comments - /*     */

 Semicolon in j.S - It tell that code is complete here and in J.S it is not mandatory to apply this but having a nature of appplying it , is a good habbit.



Variables -- It is like a container and used to store any type of the data .

There is three stages of a variable.
1.Decleration    var a;
2.Initialization var a="Ankit"
3. use           console.log(a)

We have 3 ways to store the data in js.

(A)Let (B) Var (c) Const


Assignement operator -- It assign the left hand value in right hand variable.

 let age="20", year="30";
console.log(year);
console.log(age);   It is also possible.

Var -- It can be re-declared and update and it is a global level scope.

Let -- (1)It can not be re-declared and but can be re -update and it is block scope.

(2) Agr hum let ke sath variable decelare krke chod dete haia aur use print krna chate hai to wo print hoga aur output undefined aayega.


Const -- (1)It can not be re -declared and can not be re update and it is also a block level scope.

(2)It should be always declarize and initilization together.

(3)Agr hum const ke sath variable decelare krke chod dete haia aur use print krna chate hai to wo print nhi hoga aur output me error aayega




 ---** Agr hum bina declare kre hi value console kre to refrence error aayega --**



 Data Types -- In Javascript there is two type of datatype.

(A) primitive :7 types :string, bollean ,symbol,bigInt,Number, null, undefined.

 (B) Non-primitive : Array ,Object.

 Typeof() is a operator and it is used to identify dataype.

Type Conversion -- When we convert undefined into a Number ,it becomes NAN and,  Null becomes 0 , and true and false becomes 1 and 0..

Truthy and Falsy value= Falsy value are "",nan,undefined,null

*** - " " string with space is always a truthy value.

Opearotor -- It is used to perform operations on operands.

It can be unary or binary. if a operator has one operand is unary operator 
ex- let x = 1;

x = -x;
alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied.


 


              Class -03 with School4u   Operator

Arithmetic operator, assignemnt ,logical, comaparision,increment & decrement ,ternary, Bitwise operator


(1) Arithmetic Operator-
 Everything is same as mathematical but here is two diffrent two opertor.

conosole.log(5%2)   1
console.log(2**3)    8

When we divide in js ,we do not get precise value like
console.log(7/2) 3.5


(2) Comaprison Operator - It throw output in true or false value

== - It is loosely coupled and it check only value.
=== - It is strictly coupled and it check firstly data type and after that check value.

!= -  search for value
!== - check firstly  data type and then value 

(3)Logical Operator
And(&&) OR(||) not(!)


(4) Increment $ Decrement operator

It has mainly two types.

(A) Pre increment/decrement  -- It holds the value first and then increase or decrese.

Ex- let a=10;
console.log(++a)   10
console.log(a)   11

(B) Post increment/decrement



Short Circuting in jS--

Nullish coalising opeator -

OR Opearor - For OR Logical opearator it evaluates from left to right and where it get true ,stop and return true

AND OPEARATOR- It goes till end and where it gets false value ,it just stop there and if don't get false value ,it return last value.

NUllish coaeliscing - IT mainly works on null and undefined value.

Operator Preecidence -- IN J.S if there is same precence then it evaluates from left to right.

Multiply and division ka  precidence same hota hai 



Questions Practice on Opearator

(1)How can you chain assignment opearator?





                      ## Class No -04 ## (Conditional in JS)


There is different type of conditioal statement
(1) if statement
(2) if else statemnet
(3) if..else..if
(4) Nested if statements
(5)Switch statement
(6)Ternary statement



        #Class No -05 Loop in javascript.

    (1) While-- Condition is not certain.
     (2) For=when condition is certain , we use this
     (3)For of Looop == Mailny use in string,arrray,object and return the actial value
    (4) For in Loop== it helps to find the index of character and retirn the index of array or string

    



               #  Class NO -06 String & Array in J.S

String-- It is a piece of code .single letter, or even empty -anything made of characters.


String are immutable in javascript and it has index of characters and if you want to manipukate it you can not manipulate directly ,you will have to store it in a variable.


Escape sequences: Escape sequences look like 2 character but they count as 1 character in string.


Strings me mainly for in loop ka use krna chaiee.


String Properties and Method--

Properties- it tell only information and it called without parenthesis.  Ex - str.length

Methods- it works something for string.
str.toLowerCase()
.trim() ,includes()- Output in true ,false.

-- indexOf()-output in -1 when character is not present at that string.

 -- charAt(),
 -- replaced(old,new) - it select only  first , if you want to replace everything then use replaceAll(old,new)

slice(start,end) -- it dedcuts the small piece of the string. it does not incude last index .


Substring - as same as slice method but it takes also negative index.



split()-- it converts the string in Array.

in split agr ('') krte hai to wo hr ek character ko split krta hai aur agr (' ') krte hai to wo 




               # Array in javascript

Array - it can store multiple value in one place.

stack and heap in array -
Stack holds the refrence or address of a array and heap store thr array.

Create Array using array constructor
let arr- new Array("Man","Women","Boy");

 
How to check a array is array or not?

Ans= let result=Array.isArray()

What if we try to conert an object into an Array?
Ans= Return an empty array



Diffrence between both array creating methods.
let arr=[20] -- one item that is 20
let carr=new Array(20)--  20 empty items means it has length 


-- type of (Array) == Object

-- Array Methods---

(1) push()--        Chnage the original aaray 
and return new length of aaray 
and add item in end.



(2) Pop()--
 Change original ARRAY= Yes;
 Return new array == yes and return the popped element;
 works- remove item from last;

(3) unshift()--
 Change original ARRAY= Yes;
 Return new array == yes and new array length;
 works- add item from start;

(4) shift()--
 Change original ARRAY= Yes;
 Return new array == yes and return shifted element ;
 works- remove item from start ;


 (5) splice(index, how many items removed, add items)--

 Change original ARRAY= yes;
 Return  == an array of removed items ;
 works- add/remove or doing both at same time;

 (6) Slice(start,end)--
 Change original ARRAY= No;
Return  == an array of removed items  and also work with negative index;

(7)join()--
Conevrt array in a string
takes argumnt and that is optional.
Returns new array in a string type.

(8)reverse()--
Change original aaray
reverse the original aaray

(9)find()
--   Find the first matching element and if don;t get aything return undefined.
  -- Works like as a loop

  (10) flat()
  flatten the array value 
  it takes argument as much you want to flat the value




Note -- Sort() Method in javascript

-- it treat everything as a string.


             # Array Iteration Methods

             -- These all method return new array
(1)Map()-- map() takes two parameter 

(2)Filter()-- only works in truthy or falsy conditiion
