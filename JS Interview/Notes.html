                 Class -01


Compiler-- Converts the high level code (Source code) into machine code.

Program-- Set of instructions to perform an operation.

Programming- The process of wriing program.

Programer- One who writes the program.

Algortihm- Step  by step planning to solve a problem is called algorithm.


Javascript History-- Originally it named was mocha and launched on 4 december 1995 ,later changed to live script and finally javascript.


Node JS- It is a run time environment and  help to run the js code.


Alert, Propmt ,confirm -- kuch aise terms hote hai  jo vs code me directly run nhi hota hai ,mtlb error aata hai ,
Ye sare BOM hote hai .

Statemnets in J.S -- It is nothing but a synatx and statement is always seprated by semicolon





 #          Class No - 02


 Comments in Code -- Part of code which does not execaute in code and it helps to enhance the code readbility.

 Multiline comments - /*     */

 Semicolon in j.S - It tell that code is complete here and in J.S it is not mandatory to apply this but having a nature of appplying it , is a good habbit.



Variables -- It is like a container and used to store any type of the data .

There is three stages of a variable.
1.Decleration    var a;
2.Initialization var a="Ankit"
3. use           console.log(a)

We have 3 ways to store the data in js.

(A)Let (B) Var (c) Const


Assignement operator -- It assign the left hand value in right hand variable.

 let age="20", year="30";
console.log(year);
console.log(age);   It is also possible.

Var -- It can be re-declared and update and it is a global level scope.

Let -- (1)It can not be re-declared and but can be re -update and it is block scope.

(2) Agr hum let ke sath variable decelare krke chod dete haia aur use print krna chate hai to wo print hoga aur output undefined aayega.


Const -- (1)It can not be re -declared and can not be re update and it is also a block level scope.

(2)It should be always declarize and initilization together.

(3)Agr hum const ke sath variable decelare krke chod dete haia aur use print krna chate hai to wo print nhi hoga aur output me error aayega




 ---** Agr hum bina declare kre hi value console kre to refrence error aayega --**



 Data Types -- In Javascript there is two type of datatype.

(A) primitive :7 types :string, bollean ,symbol,bigInt,Number, null, undefined.

 (B) Non-primitive : Array ,Object.

 Typeof() is a operator and it is used to identify dataype.

Type Conversion -- When we convert undefined into a Number ,it becomes NAN and,  Null becomes 0 , and true and false becomes 1 and 0..

Truthy and Falsy value= Falsy value are "",nan,undefined,null

*** - " " string with space is always a truthy value.

Opearotor -- It is used to perform operations on operands.

It can be unary or binary. if a operator has one operand is unary operator 
ex- let x = 1;

x = -x;
alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied.


 


              Class -03 with School4u   Operator

Arithmetic operator, assignemnt ,logical, comaparision,increment & decrement ,ternary, Bitwise operator


(1) Arithmetic Operator-
 Everything is same as mathematical but here is two diffrent two opertor.

conosole.log(5%2)   1
console.log(2**3)    8

When we divide in js ,we do not get precise value like
console.log(7/2) 3.5


(2) Comaprison Operator - It throw output in true or false value

== - It is loosely coupled and it check only value.
=== - It is strictly coupled and it check firstly data type and after that check value.

!= -  search for value
!== - check firstly  data type and then value 

(3)Logical Operator
And(&&) OR(||) not(!)


(4) Increment $ Decrement operator

It has mainly two types.

(A) Pre increment/decrement  -- It holds the value first and then increase or decrese.

Ex- let a=10;
console.log(++a)   10
console.log(a)   11

(B) Post increment/decrement



Short Circuting in jS--

Nullish coalising opeator -

OR Opearor - For OR Logical opearator it evaluates from left to right and where it get true ,stop and return true

AND OPEARATOR- It goes till end and where it gets false value ,it just stop there and if don't get false value ,it return last value.

NUllish coaeliscing - IT mainly works on null and undefined value.

Operator Preecidence -- IN J.S if there is same precence then it evaluates from left to right.

Multiply and division ka  precidence same hota hai 



Questions Practice on Opearator

(1)How can you chain assignment opearator?





                      ## Class No -04 ## (Conditional in JS)


There is different type of conditioal statement
(1) if statement
(2) if else statemnet
(3) if..else..if
(4) Nested if statements
(5)Switch statement
(6)Ternary statement



        #Class No -05 Loop in javascript.
